# Wound Segmentatgion Project
Data were provided by FEMH hospital.
This project aim to visualize the segmented wound images which can be used to assist a doctor in assessing the wound area and recommending how to treat the wound or when to visit the hospital. We anticipate that by using such automated analyses of the wound area, a doctor's remote assessment and treatment will be more efficient.
After segmented the images, we will calculate how many pixel belongs to the wound in one image. From this number and the real size of one pixel (in cm), which were show in this paper (DOI: 10.1145/3545729.3545758), we can compute the size of wound ( in cm2). This information can help doctor to be more accurate on remote diagnosing the wound.
